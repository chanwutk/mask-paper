\section*{Broader Impact}

In this paper, we created a camera application that classifies human faces if they are wearing masks or not.
This application can make a big impact in the world of pandemics where people are required to wear masks inside indoor facilities.
With this application, these facilities can reduce the number of staff to monitor this enforcement and use machines, instead.
However, there is a downside to this application, as well.
This camera application could raise concerns in privacy as it records human faces.
In the real-world use, we would need to inform the visitors of these indoor facilities that our application only uses but not keep the video of anyone.
We also explored the problem behind the inaccuracy of our application by visualizing the layer outputs of our model.
We found that many incorrect classifications come from the fact that these images have many objects in the background and confuse our model.
In future work, we would like to improve our application by adding another neural network that detects faces.
Then, we can crop only the face part to be classified using our current model.
