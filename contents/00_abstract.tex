\begin{abstract}
As of the beginning of 2021, most restaurants, grocery stores, healthcare, and other public spaces are open.
However, people are required to wear a mask to enter those places.
In this paper, we create a camera application that determines whether a human face is wearing a mask.
The application classifies human faces using a convolutional neural network model.
This application can reduce the work of staff and increase higher protections for the sake of common benefits of everyone sharing the spaces.
