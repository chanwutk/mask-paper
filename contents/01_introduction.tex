\section{Introduction}
In the world of pandemics, itâ€™s important to protect each other to slow down the spread of COVID-19.
According to Cheng et al. [1], wearing a mask is one of the most efficient ways to not pass on or to not receive COVID-19 from respiratory droplets.
Therefore, people are required to wear masks in many indoor facilities.
With this enforcement, each facility needs extra resources to monitor this activity.
For instance, staffs in a restaurant need to make sure that all customers wear masks.
We want to minimize the resources uses in this enforcement.
Therefore, we solved this problem by creating a camera application that detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not.
The application uses a convolutional neural network model for classification.
Then, we created an application that makes use of the neural network model by filming a person and detecting whether the person is wearing a mask or not, frame by frame and in real-time.
In the end, we evaluated our model performance, and we found that our model had a 92.16\% accuracy when testing with our dataset.
With some incorrect predictions, we wanted to find out what causes the model to incorrectly classify some images.
After the model was trained, we extracted the output of network layers from our model and compared the outputs from correctly classified images and incorrectly classified images.
